Do you ever had the problem that your friend hosted a game session and went offline?
Not anymore, since Save Flash is here to save the day!

**Save Flash** is a tool that synchronizes your save games with your friends and allows you
to continue to host the server, even after the original host is offline.

Why spend money for a single server, when you can use **Save Flash** for free?
