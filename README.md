# Discontinued | Service is still running

Do you ever had the problem that your friend hosted a game session and went offline?
Not anymore, since Save Flash is here to save the day!

**Save Flash** is a tool that synchronizes your save games with your friends and allows you
to continue to host the server, even after the original host is offline.

Why spend money for a single server, when you can use **Save Flash** for free?

```

### Questions

If you have any questions, feel free to ask them in the discord server or contact me directly.
- Does this Application has any requirements?
  - On launch the app will tell you if you need to install the JDK and provide you with a link (if needed)

### Known Issues
- The Layout seems to fall apart if you swap between different aspect ratios (move to another monitor)
